# chr≈çma - Cosmetic Color Reference 

## Introduction
Chroma is designed to help people with color vision deficiency (CVD) better identify and perceive the color of makeup products. We have 4 lines of products: eye shadow, eyeliner, lip balm, and lipsticks. Each product line has multiple choices of shades. Every shade not only has a photo and a name, but it also includes a text explanation to further describe the shade color and a color combination swatch.
